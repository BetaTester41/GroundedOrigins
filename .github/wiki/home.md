# **Welcome to the Grounded Origins wiki!**
This wiki is dedicated to a more descriptive look at all the Origins added by the mod, with all key-binds & conditions related to the Origins.

Keep in mind that when a "scale" change is mentioned, the default Minecraft "scale" is 1.

# **Mod Compatibility**
This Origins mod was created with compatibility in mind. The Deer's "Forest Native" ability, for example, uses biome temperatures to detect a forest biome.

Mod-pack authors can add to the tags I've created for further compatibility. You can easily do this using KubeJS or datapacks. Depending on the popularity of the mod, I may release KubeJS compatibility scripts in the future.
